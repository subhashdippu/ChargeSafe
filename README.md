# Battery Notification App

## 📌 Introduction

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This is a simple Python-based battery notification app that monitors your device's battery level. When the battery reaches or exceeds 85% while plugged in, it provides a voice notification using text-to-speech (TTS). The app helps users avoid overcharging their device by notifying them when the battery is sufficiently charged.

## 🚀 Features

- Monitors the battery percentage of your device.
- Provides a voice alert when the battery is charged 85% or more.
- Runs in the background and checks the battery status every 60 seconds.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.xs
- The following Python libraries:
  - `psutil`: To monitor battery status.
  - `pyttsx3`: To provide text-to-speech functionality.
